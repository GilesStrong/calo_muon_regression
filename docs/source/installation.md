# Installation Guide

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.6
- Linux or Mac OSX

## Installation

The repository can be cloned using:
```
git clone https://github.com/GilesStrong/calo_muon_regression.git
```

Providing one uses Conda for one's Python environments, a suitable Python environment can be built using:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This will create a new Conda environment called `muon-regression`, which can be activated using:
```
conda activate muon-regression
```

Alternatively:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
may be used to install the dependencies.
